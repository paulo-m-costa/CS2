Fourier:

The Fourier transform of a pure sine wave would be a single Dirac Delta function
that peaks at the value corresponding to the frequency of the wave. A DFT of the
same function may have multiple Dirac Delta functions that peak at varying
amplitudes since it is merely an approximation of the wave over a brief period
of time. As the input wave increases in complexity, more and more of these peaks
are generated by the DFT until they get close enough to appear to converge and
form a wave of their own.
