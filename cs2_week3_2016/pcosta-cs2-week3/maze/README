BFS will typically be faster than DFS for small mazes where the exit is not too far ("deep")
from the start. Unlike DFS, BFS always finds the shortest route. Additionally, if there are a 
variety of possible paths, then BFS might still be faster, since the DFS could explore all
other paths before choosing the correct one.

DFS is not without its merits though. For one, it takes up less memory than BFS. For mazes that
branch a lot (large breadth) but have relatively short branches (small depth), DFS may be faster.
Finally, DFS may luck out find the correct path right away.

Stacks are used when storing reusable items e.g. plates. Usually, the plate at the top of the
stack is used first. The bottom plate can only be accessed by displacing all those on top of it.

Queues are involved in any activity involving waiting times, where people usually line up and are 
serviced on a first-come, first-serve basis.
