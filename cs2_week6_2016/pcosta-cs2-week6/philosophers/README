The greedy solution will result in a deadlock due to the inherent nature of its
algorithm. Each philosopher starts by taking the fork to the left of them. They
then attempt to take the fork to their right. However, every fork has already 
been picked up at this instance and is thus in 'locked' position, meaning that
every philosopher must wait for someone to put down their fork. Since no 
philosopher will put down their single fork, they will remain in a deadlock.

The maximum number of philosophers that can sit at any given time is four (4).
I arrived at this by considering that if there are only five forks available 
and all the philosophers take the left fork, there will still be one remaining
philosopher that can access the right fork and then eat, averting deadlock.

If all the philosophers began with a dirty, left fork, we would deadlock. This 
is because intially, each philosopher would request the right fork from his 
neighbor. The neighbor would give the right fork after cleaning it and we would
end up with each philosopher having a clean fork in his right hand, so nobody
would be able to eat.
